Description: Provides tools for the stochastic simulation of effectiveness scores to mitigate
  data-related limitations of Information Retrieval evaluation research, as described in Urbano and
  Nagler (2018) <doi:10.1145/3209978.3210043>. These tools include: fitting, selection and plotting
  distributions to model system effectiveness, transformation towards a prespecified expected value,
  proxy to fitting of copula models based on these distributions, and simulation of new evaluation
  data from these distributions and copula models.
